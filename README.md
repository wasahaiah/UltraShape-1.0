## 📖 Abstract

In this report, we introduce **UltraShape 1.0**, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a **two-stage generation pipeline**: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry.

To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel **watertight processing method** and **high-quality data filtering**. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. 

To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing **voxel-based refinement** at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via **RoPE**, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation.
