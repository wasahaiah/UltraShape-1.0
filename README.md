## 📖 Abstract

In this report, we introduce **UltraShape 1.0**, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a **two-stage generation pipeline**: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry.

To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel **watertight processing method** and **high-quality data filtering**. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. 

To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing **voxel-based refinement** at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via **RoPE**, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/UltraShape-1.0.git
cd UltraShape
# 1. Create and activate the environment
conda create -n ultrashape python=3.10
conda activate ultrashape

# 2. Install PyTorch (CUDA 12.1 recommended)
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Install cubvh (Required for MC acceleration)
pip install git+https://github.com/ashawkey/cubvh --no-build-isolation

# For Training & Sampling (Optional)
pip install --no-build-isolation "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git@stable"
pip install https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.5.0%2Bcu121/torch_cluster-1.6.3%2Bpt25cu121-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```
⬇️ Model Weights

Please download the pre-trained weights from Hugging Face [ [infinith/UltraShape](https://huggingface.co/infinith/UltraShape/tree/main) ] and place them in your checkpoint directory (e.g., ./checkpoints/).


### 2. Generate Coarse Mesh

First, use Hunyuan3D-2.1 to generate a coarse mesh from your input image.

Repository: [Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-2.1](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-2.1)

Follow the instructions in the Hunyuan3D-2.1 repository to obtain the initial mesh file (e.g., .glb or .obj).

### 3. Generate Refined Mesh

Once you have the coarse mesh, use the provided script to run the refinement stage.

Run the inference script:
```bash
sh scripts/run.sh
```

**image**: Path to the reference image.

**mesh**: Path to the coarse mesh.

**output_dir**: Directory to save the refined result.

**ckpt**: Path to the downloaded UltraShape checkpoint.

### 4. Data Preparation & Training

First, prepare the data, including watertight meshes and rendered images.
Then, run the sampling script as follows:
```
python scripts/sampling.py \
    --mesh_json data/mesh_paths.json \
    --output_dir data/sample
```

Here, mesh_json is a list containing the file paths of the watertight meshes.


The multi-node training script is:
```
sh train.sh [node_idx]
```

**training_data_list**: the folder containing train.json and val.json, which store the ID lists for datasets.

**sample_pcd_dir**: the directory containing the sampled .npz files.

**image_data_json**: the file paths of the rendered images.

You can switch between VAE and DiT training in train.sh, and specify the output directory and configuration file there as well.
